        Hi, I'm Cam. And I'm a Web Developer. <br /><br />
        JavaScript is my main love however I am slowly moulding myself into a language agnostic coder.
        My journey so far hasn't been long and I very much consider myself a Junior Dev, however I've managed to fit a
        lot in my time so far.
        <br />
        After transitioning from Civil Engineering I began a grueling bootcamp at <a href="http://www.devacademy.co.nz/" >Enspiral Dev Academy</a>.
        18 weeks later I graduated with well refined practical skills and the desire to keep expanding my knowledge.
        <br />
        Iâ€™m an open learner and value the quality of a job over the speed of which it is completed.
        I come from a Civil Engineering background but my long standing love of tech, and the future potential of tech
        prompted my transition to web development.
        This background gives me a solid base in logical processes, client communication, project management and planning.
        I will provide an enthusiastic, dedicated, co-operative personality. My non-extensive, but varied experiences
        and knowledge base will be available to use on any project.
